### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Part 3 of lab 5 is one of my favorites because of it being a simple
    version of blackjack. I grew up playing blackjack with my friends and
    being able to make a version of it from scratch really opened my eyes to
    how simple yet complex it is. This program helped me better understand
    loops.

* Lab 10

    Part 3 of lab 10 is one of my favorites because of the output produced by
    the program. It amazes me how an image with multiple gradients can be
    created by using code and reminds me that behind any drawing program is a
    complexity of letters and numbers that produce what you see on your
    computer.

* Lab 12

    Part 1 of lab 12 is similar to part 3 of lab 10 but involves more looping
    to achieve an animated series of pictures that make it look as if the
    image is moving. This time, the specific colors are seen moving either
    vertically, horizontally, and one is even blinking. Achieving this goal is
    satisfying because you see and understand how an image is created and how
    multiple stages of images are created.
